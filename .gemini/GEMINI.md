sal: Minecraft AI Guide Plugin "MineTutor"**

### **1. Project Overview**

**1.1. Project Name**  
MineTutor: Your In-Game Minecraft AI Expert

**1.2. Project Summary**  
MineTutor is a **gameplay guide plugin** for Minecraft multiplayer servers. It allows players to get real-time answers to any gameplay-related questions—such as crafting recipes, mob strategies, or resource locations—simply by asking in the chat. The plugin leverages **OpenAI's LLM technology** to provide a natural and accurate guide experience, akin to conversing with a seasoned Minecraft expert.

**1.3. Background and Rationale**  
Minecraft's high degree of freedom comes with a steep learning curve for new players. Traditional methods of learning (external wikis, video tutorials) break game immersion and fail to provide immediate answers. In a multiplayer server environment, an intuitive, in-game guide system is crucial for retaining new players and enhancing the overall community experience. MineTutor aims to **bridge this information gap**, providing a seamless way for all players to access information from within the game world.

### **2. Market Analysis & Goals**

**2.1. Target Audience**
- **New Players:** Users seeking basic survival tips and crafting recipes.
- **Intermediate Players:** Users looking for advanced information on topics like Redstone mechanics or complex building techniques.
- **Server Administrators:** Admins who want to reduce new player churn and foster a more self-sufficient community.

**2.2. Market Opportunity**
- The Minecraft player base is massive, with a significant market for server plugins.
- Most existing AI plugins focus on general-purpose chatbots or construction assistance. A high-quality plugin **specializing as a gameplay guide** has a strong competitive edge.

**2.3. Project Goals**
- **Short-term Goal (V1.0 - MVP):** Develop and release a stable core plugin that accurately answers Minecraft-related questions via a chat command. (Target: within 3 months).
- **Mid-term Goal:** Based on user feedback, improve answer accuracy, add multi-language support, and introduce the ability to learn server-specific custom information (e.g., rules, events).
- **Long-term Goal:** Establish MineTutor as a "must-have" guide plugin in the Minecraft community and explore potential monetization models (e.g., a premium version).

### **3. Service Details (V1.0 - MVP)**

**3.1. User Experience (UX/UI)**
- **Entry Point:** An intuitive chat command: `/guide`.
- **Feedback:** Clear, immediate feedback for all states: a "thinking..." message upon request, remaining time for cooldowns, and explicit error messages.
- **Output:** AI responses are clearly distinguished from regular chat with a prefix (e.g., `[MineTutor]`) and color coding.

**3.2. V1.0 Feature List**  
The initial version aims to provide a stable and usable core guide. It will include the following features:

| Category | Feature ID | Feature Name | Description | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Function** | `CORE-01` | **AI Q&A** | Submits a question to the OpenAI API via the `/guide <question>` command and outputs the formatted response to the user. | **Highest** |
| **Performance** | `PERF-01` | **Asynchronous API Handling** | Ensures API requests are handled asynchronously to prevent the main server thread from freezing or lagging. | **Highest** |
| **Abuse Prevention** | `ABUSE-01` | **Command Cooldown** | Implements a per-player cooldown to prevent API spam and control costs. Notifies the user of the remaining time. | **Highest** |
| **Configuration** | `CONF-01` | **External `config.yml`** | Allows server admins to easily configure the API key, system prompt, and custom messages via the `config.yml` file. | **Highest** |
| **User Experience**| `UX-01` | **Status Feedback Messages** | Provides clear feedback messages for various states (thinking, on cooldown, error, etc.). | **High** |
| **User Experience**| `UX-02` | **Command Aliases** | Allows the command to be triggered by aliases like `/guide` and `/ask` in addition to `/가이드`. | **Medium** |
| **Administration**| `ADMIN-01` | **Plugin Reload Command** | Provides an admin-only command (`/guide reload`) to apply changes from `config.yml` without a full server restart. | **Medium** |

### **4. Development & Operations Plan**

**4.1. Tech Stack**
- **Platform:** PaperMC (Spigot compatible)
- **Language:** Java 17
- **Build Tool:** Gradle
- **External API:** OpenAI Chat Completions API (e.g., GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4)
- **Libraries:** OkHttp (for HTTP requests), Gson (for JSON parsing)

**4.2. Development Roadmap (V1.0)**
- **Phase 1 (1 Month):**
    - Set up the development environment and project structure.
    - Develop the core logic prototype (Features `CORE-01`, `PERF-01`).
- **Phase 2 (1 Month):**
    - Implement the configuration and cooldown systems (`CONF-01`, `ABUSE-01`).
    - Finalize UX features (`UX-01`, `UX-02`) and optimize answer quality through prompt engineering.
- **Phase 3 (1 Month):**
    - Add administrative features (`ADMIN-01`) and conduct internal alpha testing.
    - Release a beta version to the community for feedback, followed by the official V1.0 release.

**4.3. Operations & Maintenance**
- **Updates:** Provide compatibility updates for major Minecraft version releases.
- **Community Management:** Use GitHub Issues or a Discord server to gather bug reports and feature requests.
- **Cost Management:** The plugin will be free to distribute. API costs will be managed via a **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** model, where server owners use their own API keys.

### **5. Risk Management & Expected Impact**

**5.1. Risk Analysis & Mitigation**

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **API Costs** | The BYOK model shifts cost to the user. The cooldown feature (`ABUSE-01`) prevents uncontrolled usage. |
| **Inaccurate Answers**| Continuous prompt engineering. The prompt will be configurable (`CONF-01`) for admins to fine-tune. |
| **Server Performance**| All external network calls will be asynchronous (`PERF-01`) to minimize impact on the main server thread. |
| **Malicious Use** | Cooldowns will deter spam. Future versions may include content filters. |

**5.2. Expected Impact**
- **Increased Server Engagement:** Helps new players adapt faster, improving overall player retention.
- **Improved Community Satisfaction:** Reduces the burden on admins to answer repetitive questions and provides players with instant help.
- **Developer's Portfolio:** A successful plugin demonstrates strong technical and project management skills.
